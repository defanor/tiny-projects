## mmsnake

Yet another, quick-and-dirty, implementation of a snake game. This one
is quite customizable (which is the primary reason of its existence),
uses [free-game](https://github.com/fumieval/free-game) (the current
version of which, supposedly, is a bit leaky). It's also my first
finished and graphical game ever.

Not sure what's the license of icons, they came from
`/usr/share/icons/oxygen/`, and the font came from a quick web search.
